<p>Many folks think the last apparel or shoes will increase your performance. Bullsh1t: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LK8sxngSWaU"><em><strong>Do not believe the hype</strong></em></a>.</p>
<p>Running, exercising is a matter of dedication, it is spiritual and physical commitment. It does not depend on the color of your shirt, the brand of your shoes, the jacket you wear or the size of your wallet. We are all equal in this sport: we all start from the same point and have to cross the same finish line. What happens in between depends (mostly) on you and you only and there is nothing that can change this fact.</p>
<p>You might be tempted to buy all the new trendy stuff, thinking it will make you better and improve your performance. Just be honest, it will not make you better, it will make you feel, which is a big difference. You probably want the new trendy stuff but you do not actually <em>need</em> it. And actually, many runners carry too many accessories but do not need it at all.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1075" align="aligncenter" width="300"]<a href="https://juli1pb.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/accessories5k.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-1075" src="/assets/accessories5k.jpg?w=300" alt="You are all set for your first 5K!" width="300" height="224" /></a> You are all set for your first 5K![/caption]</p>
<p>Just focus on the basic: all what you need is a good pair of shoe that fits you (and stick to it!), a comfortable short or pant, a tee-shirt and a handled bottle in case you are going very far. You can consider gloves and other light additional gear in case of extreme weather but not so much. Nothing else, the rest is superficial.</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop thinking the new fancy gear/shoe/whatever will make you a better runner. It will just make you feel better</li>
<li>Instead of focusing on your gear and accessories, focus on your training</li>
<li>Do not use too many accessories, it adds weight, potential discomfort and will ruin your bank account. Keep the money for a hotel room when going to a race</li>
</ol>

<p>Let me finish this CTOTW with a funny story. Three years from now: when I was working in The Netherlands, my weekly highlight was a trip to Amsterdam  to look if a new issue of Runner's World was available. Once, there was a review of the Newton shoes and, after reading it, I was really excited and definitively wanted to try them as soon as possible. I thought I would solve all my issues and will make me a stronger, faster runner. Unfortunately, at that time, Newton was not available in the Netherlands and I was not a so serious runner to order them online (plus, delivery there was really expensive). So, when coming in the USA, the first pair of shoes I bought was the Newton. I was so happy that I go for a run the very same day. After one week, I started to experience pain in my knee and kept going. I eventually switched to another shoe but keep thinking the Newton was the best shoe (hey, Runner's World recommended them dude!) so it must be true! I kept using it until I got injured. Back then I started to use Hoka and never got injured. The take-away: do not believe the hype, stick to the basics, try different things and just keep what works for you, regardless its price, color, size or shape.</p>
