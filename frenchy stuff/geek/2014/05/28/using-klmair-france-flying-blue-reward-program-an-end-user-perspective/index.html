  <article class="post-content">
  <p>Wanting to go to Paris with my partner in crime this fall, I thought I could use my miles in order to book a ticket for her. Back in 2010, when working at the European Space Agency, I traveled a lot for professional reasons. At that time, I was single and enrolled into a loyalty program because my co-worker told me that "I have to" (by the way, thanks dudes!) and accumulated miles without paying attention ... until now! This was time to take advantage of it!</p>
<p>As a french guy, I used the Air France loyalty program called "<a href="http://www.flyingblue.com">Flying Blue</a>". Long story short: you accumulate miles each time you flight. As with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smurfs">the Smurfs</a>, there are several levels that give you different advantages. I never really understood all the benefits but so far, I understood that I can have a great discount on a flight ticket. So, let's book!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://juli1pb.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/booking-issue3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-359" src="/assets/booking-issue3.jpg?w=676" alt="booking issue3" width="676" height="304" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>User-Friendly user messages</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Let's start the booking!</h1>
<p>I started to look at the potential options on May, 23 2014. I searched for a plane ticket from my lovely Pittsburgh to Paris. Dates were flexible and I tried to have a look at the different options. I found a ticket that uses all my miles and required an additional payment of 15 euros for both. Deal! I started to book the ticket. For the inbound flight, I got a ticket from Pittsburgh to Paris via Atlanta for 25000 miles and 15 euros. Then, for the outbound, it proposed me a date, but, when validating, it reported that the dates were not available and it was impossible to book the ticket. So, why the system proposed them?</p>
<p>In between, I continued to use the website and I experienced random errors, error messages that look more than debug information that a real production environment. So, in order to finish the booking process, I contacted the customer support by e-mail. They told me that the dates were not available. So, again, why the internet platform proposes them? I asked them but did not have any reply since then.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://juli1pb.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/booking-issue2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-358 size-large" src="/assets/booking-issue2.jpg?w=676" alt="booking issue2" width="676" height="104" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Thanks for helping to debug our website!</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>Finding a workaround</h1>
<p>Then, I found a workaround: instead of booking a round-trip ticket, I tried to book two one way tickets: one for the inbound flight, another for the outbound flight. Success: I can take the first one at the conditions initially indicated (25000 miles and 15 euros) but, when trying to book the second, it reported a technical error (and no longer an availability issue as when I tried to book a round-trip flight). Then, I decided to call the customer service over phone. E-mail support was not very helpful, so, let's try the phone!</p>
<p>When the guy answered my phone call, it was long and painful: he asked me to confirm all the addresses I lived during the past years to check my identity and took 10 minutes to change/update my current address (he was looking for my province in the USA ...). So, the beginning was not very promising ...</p>
<p>The dude over the phone found a flight through New-York (no more flight with a connection to Atlanta) and a return flight that requires to change the airport (yes, you read it correctly: the airport) within 2 hours. So, in other words, if you are smart enough to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleportation">teleportation</a>, you can book it. Otherwise, just forget.</p>
<p>Finally, the price was 25000 miles for each and 130 euros. So, even the inbound flight increased from 15 euros to 130 euros. So, a total of 260 euros for both with the need of having <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleportation">teleportation </a>abilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://juli1pb.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/flyingblue-error1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-360" src="/assets/flyingblue-error1.jpg?w=676" alt="flyingblue-error1" width="676" height="655" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Oh, I found the ticket I want! Let's book it!</em></p>
<h1></h1>
<h1>Finding help on the web</h1>
<p>Next step: trying to reach <a href="http://www.klm.com/home/us/en">KLM </a>customer service through <a href="http://www.twitter.com">twitter</a>. Obviously, they were quite responsive and quick to answer my request. I was impressed with my first contact. Things were going better. They made a booking for me. Magically now, the flight passed through Detroit. Requested number of miles was 25000 but the price was still 260 euros (so, yes, almost 9 times more expensive than what was proposed initially). I asked KLM over twitter why there was such a different and the only explanation I got was that airport taxes might changed. Nothing else. But why there is so much of a difference between Atlanta and Detroit?</p>
<p>As twitter is very limited (messages have to be less than 140 chars), I asked if we can communicate by e-mail. It was not possible because the twitter team communicate through ... twitter (pretty obvious bro, no?). So, I could try to contact the customer service through e-mail, which as already a failure or use the phone with a dude that is as efficient as the US post-office to handle your request.</p>
<p>To finish, I looked on the internet and still found inbound flights at $45 and 25000 miles. But when trying to book the ticket, the famous technical error popped up so that I cannot book it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://juli1pb.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/flyingblue-error2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-361" src="/assets/flyingblue-error2.jpg?w=676" alt="flyingblue-error2" width="676" height="510" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em>The lord webserver decided that you will not get your ticket!</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1>The real fix: get away from KLM and flying blue</h1>
<p>So, I can still get a flight for 260 euros. But then, I have to spend almost all my miles (which are worth 1500 euros). And when looking at the price of a ticket from competitors (about 1000 euros), spending my miles for the ticket means that I get it at 1700 euros instead of 1000 euros.</p>
<p>Loyalty program they said? Just get away from KLM, the website is just a mess, information between the different customer support centers inaccurate and not synchronized and by being a member of the loyalty program, you just end up by overpaying your plane ticket. Even if some dudes were helpful (thanks to the twitter team!), the result is the same: I cannot book a ticket at the conditions initially offered and each time, what is finally proposed does not match with the initial conditions and price.</p>
<p>The take-away: you real need service, save your time and energy? Run, drive, take the train or ultimately, take another company.</p>
