  <p>I tried to maintain a weekly mileage around 60 miles and I almost failed last week. My love for programming came back recently and I spent some (probably too much) time prototyping new tools. I finally met the weekly goal before taking of for Prague. The weather in Pittsburgh was still cold but I still used running to commute. I even attend the fundraiser event of a friend that will <a href="http://teamtassy.org/run-across-haiti">run across Haiti</a>, <a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/teamtassy">team Tassy</a> (special kudos for this project to support the community of Haiti, <a href="https://www.crowdrise.com/rodgerobley2016runac/fundraiser/rodgerobley">you can also contribute</a>)</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1984" align="aligncenter" width="313"]<img class="  wp-image-1984 aligncenter" src="/assets/rogertassy.jpg" alt="rogertassy" width="313" height="418" /> Supporting Team Tassy at Franktuary[/caption]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traveling had always been a good reason to explore new cities. And running is an efficient way to explore many places when you have a limited time, especially when you are in a conference all day. And that time, even with icy sidewalks, I enjoyed running in Prague. For sure, there is not so much elevation, but who cares?</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1964" align="aligncenter" width="407"]<img class="wp-image-1964 " src="/assets/pragueoutlook.jpg?w=500" alt="pragueoutlook" width="407" height="305" /> At the top of the city[/caption]</p>
<p>Eastern Europe is definitively underrated while countries like France are insanely overrated and have a really poor service. This is my second time in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prague">Prague</a> and I am surprised and astonished by the culture, the service and the respect I got from the residents in this country. And the food is also excellent! Way better than what I get in European countries that usually attract tourists. If you want to visit Europe, it might be worth to have a look at the East part of Europe.</p>
<p>I presented a my new research project today at the <a href="http://mils-workshop.euromils.eu/">MILS workshop</a> collocated with the <a href="https://www.hipeac.net/">HiPEAC 2016</a> conference. It is very exciting to present this new work and get feedback from the research community. After the talk, somebody came to ask me a question: "I noticed you are wearing Hoka shoes, are you an ultra-runner? I am one and will be running UTMB this year!". I assume my running profile is more appealing than my research profile!</p>
<p>The next stop will be in Toulouse to present past research results at the <a href="http://www.erts2016.org/">ERTS 2016 conference</a> and discuss with the <a href="http://www.aadl.info">AADL standardization committee</a>. And also give a talk in the <a href="http://projects.laas.fr/IFSE/FMF/J6/">Formal Methods Forum</a>. And probably to say hi to some french folks.</p>
<p>[caption id="attachment_1965" align="aligncenter" width="419"]<img class="wp-image-1965 " src="/assets/eglise.jpg?w=300" alt="eglise" width="419" height="314" /> Notre Dame in Paris? No, this shot has been taken in Prague.[/caption]</p>
<p>There are a lot of projects in the pipeline and I can't wait to work on these. In a nutshell, the main goal is to facilitate the production of verified secure systems. Something that might be important when designing critical systems, such as a car, train or a plane. You might want to make sure the car you drive or the plane you are taking are secure. Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/07/hackers-remotely-kill-jeep-highway/">this is not always the case</a>. I am planning to complete the project by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Ah, and apart that, with some luck, I should be able to come back into a regular training cycle sometime in March and get ready for the two 50k I am doing in April. I am slowly starting to be exciting to run the triple crown this year. I might need few more weeks of rest and sleep inside my warm bed in order to be fully rest and ready for it.</p>
