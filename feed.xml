        <title>Periodic tasks with seL4</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;in-a-nutshell&quot;&gt;In a nutshell&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I explain how to implement periodic tasks in seL4, a design pattern used in many embedded, safety-critical systems. This sounds probably very basic but using periodic tasks with non-blocking communication mechanisms is really helpful to ensure that your system will continue to work and meet its deadline. Please not that it does not mean that it works correctly, it just guarantees some important timing and behavioral characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;context&quot;&gt;Context&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sel4.systems/&quot;&gt;seL4 micro-kernel&lt;/a&gt; since few months. For those who do not know what is seL4, this is a formally verified kernel. Formally verified means that seL4 services are &lt;em&gt;correctly&lt;/em&gt; implemented. It does not mean that the services are &lt;em&gt;correctly&lt;/em&gt; configured and used, which is another story (more on that in a further article).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The micro-kernel itself provides only very few services, mostly: &lt;abbr title=&quot;Thread Control Block&quot;&gt;TCB&lt;/abbr&gt;, endpoints and other communications services. Nothing more, especially time or scheduling. Device drivers are also implemented in user-space, meaning that partitions must require access to the hardware and manage it appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, writing code for seL4 is hard. Really hard. You have not only to understand the services but also use the API and do the right function calls with the appropriate arguments. Trust me, it is a real pain. In order to overcome these issues, the NICTA team developed a specific &lt;abbr title=&quot;Architecture Description Language&quot;&gt;ADL&lt;/abbr&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.sel4.systems/CAmkES&quot;&gt;CAmkES&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;issue-with-sel4-and-periodic-tasks&quot;&gt;Issue with seL4 and periodic tasks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, seL4 does not provide any timing service. It provides a service to schedule threads (using a Round-Robin policy with priorities) but does not provide anything to wait or be activated at a given period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, if you are looking for something like &lt;code&gt;pthread_cond_timedwait()&lt;/code&gt; or just &lt;code&gt;sleep()&lt;/code&gt; (which is &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; real-time friendly by the way), you will feel out of luck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To overcome this issue, you must design your own timing service in a process that will ultimately activate the other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;implement-a-timing-service&quot;&gt;Implement a timing service&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will implement a timing service with CAmkES. The timing service will define a hardware component (hardware timer) and a time manager that will activate the tasks according to their periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following example, we will have two periodic tasks: one is activated every second while the other one is activated every two seconds. We will then define four components:
 1. The hardware component that abstracts the hardware platform
 2. The time manager that manages the hardware components and send a signal to activate the other tasks. One signal will be sent every second, another every two seconds
 3. One task connected to the first signal (activated every second)
 4. One task connected to the second signal (activated every two seconds)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will illustrate that with the x86 platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;defining-the-camkes-components&quot;&gt;Defining the CAmkES components&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall architecture is defined below. The CAmkES hardware component models your time, what will give you the concept of time. On the x86 architecture, there is the old &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.osdev.org/Programmable_Interval_Timer&quot;&gt;&lt;abbr title=&quot;Programmable Interval Interrupt&quot;&gt;PIT&lt;/abbr&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that provides the concept of time. We will use it then. For more information about how it works, you can read the description on &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.osdev.org/Programmable_Interval_Timer&quot;&gt;osdev&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/Programmable_Interval_Timer&quot;&gt;wikibooks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/sel4-timer-architecture.png&quot; alt=&quot;architecture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The timer components and timer managment in CAmkES are defining like the following (&lt;code&gt;Timerbase&lt;/code&gt; being the hardware component and &lt;code&gt;Timer&lt;/code&gt; the time manager)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;component Timerbase {
   hardware;
   provides IOPort command;
   provides IOPort channel0;
   emits PITIRQ irq;
}

component Timer {
  uses IOPort   pit_command;
  uses IOPort   pit_channel0;
  has mutex     timer;
  consumes DataAvailable  irq;

  emits sig Hello1_Thr_activator;
  emits sig Hello2_Thr_activator;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Timerbase&lt;/code&gt; component accesses two &lt;code&gt;IOPort&lt;/code&gt; that are hardware register/memories used to control the timer. This is architecture-dependent and related to the &lt;abbr title=&quot;Programmable Interval Interrupt&quot;&gt;PIT&lt;/abbr&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;irq&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to the interrupt sent by the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, let’s define the application component (application task). We call it &lt;code&gt;HelloThreadImpl&lt;/code&gt;. This task is a control task that will consumes a signal that activates it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;component HelloThreadImpl
{
  control;
  consumes sig activator;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we need to create an assembly that integrates and configures all components. The assembly corresponds to the components configuration showed in the picture before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import &amp;lt;std_connector.camkes&amp;gt;;
import &quot;components/timer/Timer.camkes&quot;;
import &quot;components/HelloThreadImpl/HelloThreadImpl.camkes&quot;;
assembly {
  composition {
    component Timerbase timerbase;
    component Timer timer;


    component HelloThreadImpl Hello1_Thr;
    component HelloThreadImpl Hello2_Thr;

    connection seL4Notification notification0
     (from timer.Hello1_Thr_activator, to Hello1_Thr.activator);
                connection seL4Notification notification1 (from timer.Hello2_Thr_activator, to Hello2_Thr.activator);

    connection seL4HardwareInterrupt timer_irq
      (from timerbase.irq, to timer.irq);

    connection seL4HardwareIOPort pit_command
      (from timer.pit_command, to timerbase.command);

  connection seL4HardwareIOPort pit_channel0
      (from timer.pit_channel0, to timerbase.channel0);
  }

  configuration {
    timerbase.irq_attributes = 0;
    timerbase.command_attributes = &quot;0x43:0x43&quot;;
    timerbase.channel0_attributes = &quot;0x40:0x40&quot;;
  }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We define the timer component (one of type &lt;code&gt;Timerbase&lt;/code&gt; and one of type &lt;code&gt;Timer&lt;/code&gt;) as well as two software components. The connections &lt;code&gt;notification0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;notification1&lt;/code&gt; are the one that will activate the tasks through a signal, to notify them that they can be activated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;configuration&lt;/code&gt; section, the hardware component is configured. This part is architecture-dependent and if you are planning to use such a pattern on another architecture, you would need to adapt the hardware component specification and its relative configuration section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implementing-the-code&quot;&gt;Implementing the code&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, we need to implement the &lt;code&gt;Timer&lt;/code&gt; and the &lt;code&gt;HelloThreadImpl&lt;/code&gt; components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the timer, there is a part that is architecture-dependent and another that is generic and activates the tasks. We will skip the architecture-dependent part, you can look at it in the code by yourself. The most interesting part is in the interrupt handler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the driver interrupt handler, we get the current time in milliseconds. Then, depending on the value, we send a signal to activate a task. In the following code, we send a signal to the first task every 1000 ms and send a signal to the second task every 2000 ms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;void irq_callback(void *_ UNUSED)
{
  timer_handle_irq(timer_drv, 0);

  uint64_t ms = current_time_ms();

  if ( ( ms % 1000) == 0)
  {
    Hello1_Thr_activator_emit();
  }

  if ( ( ms % 2000) == 0)
  {
    Hello2_Thr_activator_emit();
  }

  irq_reg_callback(irq_callback, NULL);
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s have a look at the &lt;code&gt;HelloThreadImpl&lt;/code&gt; code now. It should be pretty obvious with an infinite loop waiting for a signal and executing a piece of code. The code is provided below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;#include &amp;lt;camkes.h&amp;gt;

#include &amp;lt;generatedtypes.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;string.h&amp;gt;

void user_hello_spg ()
{
  printf *&quot;HELLO\n&quot;);
}

int run(void)
{
  while (1)
  {
    activator_wait();
    user_hello_spg ( );
  }
  return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;getting-the-code--run-it&quot;&gt;Getting the code &amp;amp; run it&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code is availabe &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/sel4-timer.tgz&quot;&gt;there&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to run it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check out CAmkES and make sure it works on your system. To get started, have a look &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.sel4.systems/CAmkES&quot;&gt;on the instruction on the seL4 wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get the code &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/sel4-timer.tgz&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;decompress the archive into the &lt;code&gt;apps/&lt;/code&gt; directory of the CAmkES installation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Edit the &lt;code&gt;Kconfig&lt;/code&gt; file at the root directory of your CAmkES installation and add in the &lt;code&gt;Applications&lt;/code&gt; section the following line: &lt;code&gt;source &quot;apps/twotasksx86instance/Kconfig&quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;invoke &lt;code&gt;make ia32_simple_defconfig&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;invoke &lt;code&gt;make oldconfig&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;invoke &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If everything compiles fine, it means that a simple example for the ia32 platform works. We can then compiles the example from this article&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Invoke &lt;code&gt;make menuconfig&lt;/code&gt;. In the menu, in the &lt;code&gt;Applications&lt;/code&gt; section, unselect all examples and select &lt;code&gt;Generated CAmkES TwotasksX86Instance application &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;exit the configuration tool and save the changes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;invoke &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;simulate the system with qemu by invoking &lt;code&gt;qemu-system-i386 -nographic -kernel images/kernel-ia32-pc99 -initrd images/capdl-loader-experimental-image-ia32-pc99&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When running the code, you should just see that you get more output every two seconds. Basically, every second, you get two &lt;em&gt;HELLO&lt;/em&gt; message on the console while every two seconds, you see two messages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;issues--limitations&quot;&gt;Issues &amp;amp; limitations&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, I tried to explain how to use seL4 and its related &lt;abbr title=&quot;Architecture Description Language&quot;&gt;ADL&lt;/abbr&gt; in order to implement a popular design pattern for safety-critical systems: a periodic tasks. As seL4 provides very minimal services and as no built-in timing service, you must define them yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, one can notice that there is some issues with such an approach. First of all, it assumes that the system is &lt;em&gt;schedulable&lt;/em&gt; and that all tasks will complete their job and will not interfere with the execution of the other tasks. If one task that is at a high priority takes all the CPU (in other word, if the code in &lt;code&gt;user_hello_spg&lt;/code&gt; contains an infinite loop), your system will be stuck. One workaround would be to use the concept of domains in seL4 but unfortunately, it does not seem that CAmkES exports it to the user. Also, the system does not &lt;em&gt;enforce&lt;/em&gt; any timing budget. The NICTA team is working on some real-time extensions that might provide such services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: You might find some error/bugs in the code, this is mostly done for educational purposes. If you find any issue/bug, do not hesitate to contact me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Entering the star system</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, I was featured on &lt;a href=&quot;http://theruncommuter.com&quot;&gt;The Run Commuter website&lt;/a&gt;. I got my own article, which is definitively a true honor. I feel that I now belong to the club of the runners that got this exposure. It is also really funny because I just got injured one week before it was published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://theruncommuter.com/the-new-run-commuters-february-2016/&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2239&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2239&quot; src=&quot;/assets/runcommuter.png&quot; alt=&quot;runcommuter&quot; width=&quot;660&quot; height=&quot;348&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this week, the pacer page on the Pittsburgh marathon was just published. And of course, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thepittsburghmarathon.com/pace-team&quot;&gt;my ugly face is on it&lt;/a&gt;. Yay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thepittsburghmarathon.com/pace-team&quot; rel=&quot;attachment wp-att-2240&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;aligncenter size-full wp-image-2240&quot; src=&quot;/assets/paceteam.png&quot; alt=&quot;paceteam&quot; width=&quot;660&quot; height=&quot;191&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that all of that is finally getting real and I will have to run a half marathon in 1:45 in May while entertaining people around me. I tried to avoid everything running related since several weeks, including contact with the running community but it might be time to treat the several muscles injuries, tendinitis and remain of fractures that keep me away from running since several weeks now. Between a coming trip to Japan, another in France and a last one in Italy, I should find some time to train.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>BeagleBoard Black (BBB) and GPIO</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;When you buy a &lt;a href=&quot;http://beagleboard.org/black&quot;&gt;Beagleboard Black&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. BBB), it comes with a pre-installed version of debian with more or less everything you need to get started. I purchased the board for another purpose and develop seL4 components on top of it. But before starting to develop on seL4, it is useful to know exactly how the board works: once you know how the board works, you can start to write your code and know for sure that the bug comes from your code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will explain quickly how to set up a simple circuit to test the GPIO of the beaglebone.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img class=&quot;  wp-image-2231 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;/assets/cape-headers-digital.png&quot; alt=&quot;cape-headers-digital.png&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;225&quot; /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mapping between pin numbers and GPIO ID from&lt;a href=&quot;http://beagleboard.org/support/bone101&quot;&gt; bone 101&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Setting up the circuit&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test the circuit, you need only a breadboard, a resistance and a LED. Simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connect the PIN 14 (which is mapped to GPIO id 50, see table) from bank P9 (green cable on the picture) on the breadboard. Connect it to a resistance and a LED. The other pin of the LED is then connected to the ground (last PIN of P9).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;  wp-image-2224 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;/assets/board.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;board&quot; width=&quot;460&quot; height=&quot;345&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wiring scheme of the example&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Controlling the GPIO in Linux&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Linux, the GPIO can be controlled using the SysFS abstraction layer. You can access it through&lt;em&gt; /sys/class/gpio. &lt;/em&gt;I am using the pre-installed debian software on the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To control a particular pin, you must export it. You do it by writing the value of the pin you want to export into &lt;em&gt;/sys/class/gpio/export&lt;/em&gt;. Then, a new directory is &lt;em&gt;/sys/class/gpio/gpio&amp;lt;PIN-NUMBER&amp;gt;&lt;/em&gt; is created with many different files to control the pin (direction, value, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our example, the &lt;strong&gt;pin 14 from the bank P9&lt;/strong&gt; correspond to &lt;strong&gt;GPIO 50&lt;/strong&gt;. You can see the corresponding mapping between the pin and GPIO number in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://beagleboard.org/support/bone101&quot;&gt;beaglebone 101 &lt;/a&gt;document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, let&#39;s start by exporting this pin:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;echo 50 &amp;gt; /sys/class/gpio/export&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, a new directory /sys/class/gpio/gpio50 is created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s set its direction to out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;echo out &amp;gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio50/direction&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let&#39;s set its value to 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;echo 1 &amp;gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio50/value&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, if you want to make the LED blinks every second, you can use this command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;while [ 1 ]; do echo 1 &amp;gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio50/value ; sleep 1 ; echo 0 &amp;gt; /sys/class/gpio/gpio50/value ; sleep 1 ; done&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Enjoying the break</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;No running since more than a week and definitively enjoying the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not sure how long it is going to last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Shame on you WS100</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article59462939.html&quot;&gt;Western States 100 added a new rule in order that deny race entry to any athlete who has been caught using performance-enhancing drugs from competing in Western States&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armstrong did not even mention he wanted to run this race. He runs every now and then (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.strava.com/athletes/1712082&quot;&gt;his strava profile&lt;/a&gt; is very active) and recently won a trail race. But he did not sign up for the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organizers reacted over a non-existing threat. Just by fear. Or just to make noise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why banning him? This sport is all about community, not about rejection. We are a welcoming community. How many of us struggled with life, suffered from various addictions and find salvation through ultra running? How many stories of people stopping drinking, doing drugs or losing weight that stopped when they start running? Armstrong wants to join us? He is more than welcome. There is no reason to reject him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many solutions to offer a fair treatment if he is running: enable drug testing during the race (for &lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; runner - let&#39;s be serious: some elites &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; using performance enhancing drugs, why not testing them?) or just let him to race without receiving an award/money. But there is no reason to reject somebody without trying to work things out. And by taking such a decision, the race organizers might have show that our sport is slowly evolving ... probably not for the best.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Work &amp; Injury</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This week, a new blog post about my ongoing work on software security has been published on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/sei_blog/2016/02/improving-system-and-software-security-with-aadl.html&quot;&gt;SEI blog&lt;/a&gt;. This work is being very exciting and I am currently working on other publication. During the next week, I will also work on a code generator that will transform an architecture model into C code executed on top of &lt;a href=&quot;http://sel4.systems&quot;&gt;seL4&lt;/a&gt;, the only formally verified kernel that has been used for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.darpa.mil/program/high-assurance-cyber-military-systems&quot;&gt;HACMS&lt;/a&gt; program from DARPA. This will facilitates the design, implementation and verification of secure systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/sei_blog/2016/02/improving-system-and-software-security-with-aadl.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;alignnone size-full wp-image-2127&quot; src=&quot;/assets/screenshot-2016-02-04-at-11-11-07-pm.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot 2016-02-04 at 11.11.07 PM&quot; width=&quot;1010&quot; height=&quot;413&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a running side, running is becoming so painful that I no longer enjoy it. Every step is painful. A pause is necessary after every mile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need a new strategy to recover, avoid any permanent damage and maintain my fitness level. But running is no longer an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More on that soon.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport: a metaphor of the evolution of France</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;As a researcher working with an international standard committee, publishing papers and attending international conferences, I travel a lot. I often visit Europe, and, coming from the USA, the Paris Charles de Gaulle (CDG) airport is where I take most of my connecting flights. Last, as a french-native, I sometimes come back in the country to visit my family and then, land at this airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;  wp-image-2106 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;/assets/cdgdropoff.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;cdgdropoff&quot; width=&quot;339&quot; height=&quot;452&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way to the passenger drop-off. You have big baggages? Be ready for a nice workout and work on your arms!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a french citizen and having lived in this country for more than 27 years, I am ashamed of this airport. It does not make justice to this country and its capital, which deserve better than that. This airport reproduces everything you can hate about france.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I regularly took this airport since 2008. I tried to provide feedback, I thought that it might help the airport to improve itself. This airport is also rated as one of the worst in Europe (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://travel.cnn.com/explorations/life/10-most-hated-airports-324645/&quot;&gt;here on CNN &lt;/a&gt;or here on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.offtoeurope.com/europes-best-and-worst-airports/&quot;&gt;offeurope&lt;/a&gt; or here ). So, with this in mind and also with regularly feedback from its users (I hope I was not the same to send feedback), I was hoping progress would have happened over the last years. But after 8 more years, all what I see is just an airport that is a real mess, where passengers get lost, transiting from two gates within the same terminal can take more than 30 minutes and does not even provide basic services such an airport deserves. This is what you want to show to the visitors of the most visited capital in the world? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, let&#39;s see at some of the reasons the airport is so bad:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;accessibility between terminals&lt;/strong&gt;: terminals are a mess and for some terminals, you need to take a bus to move within the terminal. But not for all terminals! It can take up to 30 to 45 minutes to navigate within the same terminal. So, if you have to switch terminals, at least one hour is a reasonable bet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;a&lt;strong&gt;ccessibility within the airport&lt;/strong&gt;: stairs and lift are very very narrow and disabled people might have a hard time moving. Like everything in france, everything is narrow and small (french have this tendency to associate &quot;petit&quot; with all the words). Unfortunately, tourists coming for 2 weeks have big baggages. So, using the stairs is just a mess and most of the times, this is just a pain to carry your baggage. Also, when you arrive at some terminal, you have to use stairs and there are only small lift if you have heavy baggage or if you are disabled. Welcome in france, the country where we welcome everybody, especially the people in good health and will not stay too long!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;accessibility of restrooms&lt;/strong&gt;: there are very limited, their maintenance is terrible so that you might not even use them. Most of them no longer have soap and dryer are not working. I understand no why my US friends think french people do not clean themselves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lack of information of baggage claims&lt;/strong&gt;: when you exit your flights, signs for baggage claims and information about where to find your baggage are hidden and not available. On my last flight, I found my baggage on a random ramp. Sure, there was a screen to give information but there was nothing on the screen itself. Ah, the pleasure to find your own baggage at 9pm!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lack of information at border controls&lt;/strong&gt;: recently, during a connection, I got stuck in a corridor because of ID control. While I understand the airport has no control on the requirements of french authorities, it could at least provide accurate information to passengers. Instead of waiting 30 minutes while connecting flights in a corridor without giving any information, I would expect to wait in a big hall/room where the ID control takes places (what you have in most US airport) and where people can seat, go to the restroom or have access to water (if there was any water fountain). But as the room dedicated to ID check is as big as the stairs (remember, in france, everything is small), there is no space and so, people wait in line in a corridor and just wondering what is going on. This is probably a way to show to our tourists how dedicated we are to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;wireless&lt;/strong&gt;: the wireless requires to authenticate, give your name, e-mail, nationality, etc so that they can trace you and send you obnoxious ads. Fine. But you have to authenticate every time you move and your device connects to a new access point. So, you land: you have to authenticate. You try to access again when moving: you have to authenticate again every minute. You arrive at your gate: authenticate again. I think this is a way to promote the Minitel, a french thing that was supposed to beat the internet. Seriously, this shows the incompetence of the airport to provide a reasonably sized and user-friendly wireless network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;availability of water fountains&lt;/strong&gt;: most airports now provide water fountains. This is important for an economic and ecological perspectives: why do you want to buy plastic bottles if you carry your own? And why paying for water, this is not a common good, especially when the Mayor of Paris previously declared the tap water was as good as bottled water? While there are plenty of water fountains in other airports (probably one next to every restroom in the USA), I found one or two in the whole airport. No kidding. I tried to reach out on twitter about this issue, the airport staff told me they can give me a map of the water fountains. So, just to make sure: every tourist that want water would need to contact the airport to find a water fountain! Please do not be too thirsty and take enough time: if you have to go to another gate, it might take more than 30 minutes to fill your bottle and so, more than one hour to come back to your gate. France is definitively a leader in the green economy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;  wp-image-2111 aligncenter&quot; src=&quot;/assets/cdgbus.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;cdgbus.jpg&quot; width=&quot;503&quot; height=&quot;377&quot; /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Taking the terminal E2? This is the bus map with all the drops. Ask an attendant at the airport, some are not aware there is a bus!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just some issues I recurrently experienced as a user of the airport. I am ashamed to know that tourists arrive to this country by such a airport. It should be a convenient, pleasant and useful place that welcomes and helps you when you arrive. It should be easy to use and navigate and go to the city (and I did not even talk about transportation to the city which is also a real shame). Not the actual mess we see every day and that &lt;a href=&quot;http://travel.cnn.com/explorations/life/10-most-hated-airports-324645/&quot;&gt;people actually hates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not understand why the company that manages the airport made this mess. The airport is not too old and I do not understand why there are so many accessibility issues (people using the terminal 2F can probably testify about the restroom accessibility). This is the hub of the most visited capital, so, having a good airport is a strategic investment. Other European cities develop very nice airports (particularly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.offtoeurope.com/europes-best-and-worst-airports/&quot;&gt;Amsterdam with Schiphol&lt;/a&gt;, very convenient), which proves making a big HUB with a lot of tourist transits is possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What astonished me is that the evolution of this airport sounds exactly as the evolution of this country. We changed the appearance, it looks nice from the outside (there are a lot of fancy shop in the airport, you can buy all the bullshit stuff that makes france famous) but they did not invest in the fundamentals: moving, getting around, services, connecting and having information. This is also the general feeling I have when I see this country: a strong focus on trying to work on the unnecessary cosmetics details whereas the fundamentals are still being neglected. Beyond these issues is the denial of the people: when you tell people that the airport have issues, they reply to you that there are no issue and that you are doing things wrong. They are telling you that the airport is not the problem and that you are the problem. Unfortunately and currently, facts and numbers showed the reality: the airport is considered as one of the worst in the world and it seems that france is definitively a sinking ship people are trying to escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sad.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Killing Treadmill boredom with TED talks</title>
        <description>&lt;img class=&quot; size-full wp-image-2083 alignright&quot; src=&quot;/assets/cheese.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;cheese&quot;/&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shopping and tasting cheese in Toulouse&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the cold weather and travels, it is difficult to go &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; outside. It might be possible but definitively inefficient: if I have 30 minutes, this is way better to hit the gym rather than spending 10 minutes to look at the area on google maps, see where to go, ask for a map at the reception, etc. For short workouts, it is more convenient and efficient to hit the gym.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the downside, such places are packed with gym rats and the view is not as entertaining as trails. Also, watching TV becomes boring very quickly. Plus, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.netflix.com&quot;&gt;netflix&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pandora.com&quot;&gt;pandora&lt;/a&gt; are either blocked or too slow (depending on the country and hotel policy for using the wireless network). So, I took advantage of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ted.android&quot;&gt;TED android application&lt;/a&gt;: you can download video to watch later. So, you can browse all the talks, choose carefully some talks and find good one while you actually work out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to make a short list of good TED talks - if you are planning to hit the gym or looking for some stuff to watch at home, there is a list. I hope it might be useful to some of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/benjamin_wallace_on_the_price_of_happiness&quot;&gt;The Price of Happiness&lt;/a&gt; by Benjamin Wallace - expensive stuff will not make you happy, this talk explains why. I always believe the most important value is in things that cannot have a price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/william_li?language=en&quot;&gt;Can we eat to starve cancer?&lt;/a&gt; by William Li - inspiring talk that presents a new way to treat and potentially kill cancer. While we focus on invasive solution, I truly believe a long-term, proactive approach that focuses on what we eat everyday is more efficient than the actual solution that are invasive, aggressive and intrusive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/james_veitch_this_is_what_happens_when_you_reply_to_spam_email?language=en&quot;&gt;This is what happens when you reply to spam&lt;/a&gt; by James Veitch - epic and funny talk, very refreshing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/marc_kushner_why_the_buildings_of_the_future_will_be_shaped_by_you#&quot;&gt;Why the building of the future will be shaped by ... you&lt;/a&gt; by Marc Kushner - amazing talk about the value and important of architecture: how it shapes and impacts our life. Small changes have a big impact for years. Definitively a topic to think about and can apply to many other domains (who said software or computer architecture?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ted.com/talks/ann_cooper_talks_school_lunches&quot;&gt;What&#39;s wrong with school lunches&lt;/a&gt; by Ann Cooper - a simple (but smart) talk about actual issues with food provided in schools. Valuable talk by somebody that actually works in this domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Bonjour Toulouse</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;After some days in the country side, it is now time to head to Toulouse to give a tutorial during the &lt;a href=&quot;http://projects.laas.fr/IFSE/FMF/J6/&quot;&gt;formal method day&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.laas.fr&quot;&gt;LAAS lab &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.erts2016.org/authors_detail_inverted_Delange%20Julien.html&quot;&gt;present one research paper at ERTS 2016&lt;/a&gt;. I had a last run in Normandy this morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot; wp-image-2051&quot; src=&quot;/assets/normandyemorning.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Road in Normandy in the Morning&quot; width=&quot;523&quot; height=&quot;392&quot; /&gt; &lt;p&gt;Road in Normandy in the Morning&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My right leg is definitively destroyed. The repeated long runs on pavement in Prague had a cost I am paying right now. After reaching my weekly goal of 60 miles, I might take some time off: too painful to run, it feels it might eventually hide more serious damages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/francois.dhaene/&quot;&gt;Francois d&#39;Haene&lt;/a&gt; won &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hk100-ultra.com/&quot;&gt;HK100&lt;/a&gt;. No kidding.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;img class=&quot;size-medium wp-image-2052&quot; src=&quot;/assets/dhaene.png?w=300&quot; alt=&quot;D&#39;Haene finishing strong HK100 (photo irunfar)&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; height=&quot;199&quot; /&gt;
